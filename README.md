# DC-Woodworking
This is the first website I made myself! I wanted to make something for my dad, who does various woodworking projects.

Languages Used:
HTML, CSS (Bootstrap).

Things I want to work on:
Some styling could have been done better/cleaner. I feel like I went between using the bootstrap styling and CSS styling a lot on similar things (ex. padding, margins)
Formatting the images was difficult - not sure if it was because my images were all different sizes or I was missing a trick, but I think I could clean that up.
